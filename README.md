# Self Driving Car Project

### Project List

1. [Advanced Lane Line Detection Pipeline](https://github.com/Vasuji/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines): Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using OpenCV for Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection, distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.

2. Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from an automotive camera taken during highway driving.

3. Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.

4. Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and drop out to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.

5. Implemented sensor fusion technique in C++ with an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm capable of tracking a pedestrian's motion in two dimensions and an Unscented Kalman Filter algorithm capable of accurately and performantly tracking a turning object.

6. Implemented a 2-dimensional localization algorithm with Markove filter and particle filter in C++ capable of localizing a vehicle within desired accuracy and time.
