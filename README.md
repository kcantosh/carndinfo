 I am a Physicist. Currently, my interests are in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have two parallel thoughts for model building perspective: simulation of a mathematical model and optimization of the proposed model over a large data set. I think more in first perspective 'simulation of a mathematical model' when we are familiar with dynamics of the system under study and explore more in that part where analytical solution does not exist. Here we technically go from model to data generation. The second part 'optimization of the proposed model' comes with machine learning which goes from data to model building (opposite to the first one). Proper feature engineering and tuning of the model parameters are the most important part of the optimization.

### Self Driving Car Projects

***Project 1.*** [***Advanced Lane Line Detection Pipeline***](https://github.com/Vasuji/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines): 

Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using OpenCV for Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection, distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.

***Project 2.*** [***Vehicle Detection Pipeline*** ](https://github.com/Vasuji/CarND-Vehicle-Detection): 

Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from an automotive camera taken during highway driving. [Project Detail](https://github.com/Vasuji/CarND-Vehicle-Detection)
